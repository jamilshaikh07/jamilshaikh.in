I've been writing on Medium for a while now, mostly about Kubernetes, infrastructure, and the SRE world. It's a great platform, but I wanted a place that's truly mine — somewhere I can write without worrying about paywalls or algorithms.

## Why a personal blog?

A few reasons:

- **Ownership** — My content lives in a git repo. I can version it, back it up, and it'll outlast any platform.
- **Simplicity** — It's just Markdown files built with Hugo. No databases, no CMS, no dependencies to worry about.
- **Practice what I preach** — As an SRE, I'm always talking about GitOps and infrastructure as code. This blog is deployed the same way — push to `main`, GitHub Actions builds it, and it's live.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about the things I work with daily:

- Kubernetes patterns and anti-patterns
- Platform engineering and developer experience
- Homelab experiments with Talos Linux and Proxmox
- Cloud architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Debugging war stories
